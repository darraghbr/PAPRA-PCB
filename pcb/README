The Teta PAPRA project requires 2 PCBAs

PapraFanBoxPCB - this is a connection board
PaprControlPCB - this is a speed controller that allows for adjusting speed of blower

Note:
A PCB is a bare board.
A PCBA is an assembly of a PCB and OTS (off the shelf) components, which are typically a mix of surface mount and thru-hole components.
